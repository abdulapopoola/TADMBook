4.36. Consider an *n×n* array *A* containing integer elements (positive, negative, and zero). 
Assume that the elements in each row of *A* are in strictly increasing order, and the elements 
of each column of *A* are in strictly decreasing order. (Hence there cannot be two zeroes in the 
same row or the same column.) Describe an efficient algorithm that counts the number of 
occurrences of the element *0* in *A*. Analyze its running time.

**Solution**

This is also very similar to [4.35](https://github.com/abdulapopoola/TADMBook/blob/master/Chapter%204/4.35.md).

Algorithm

First attempt
* Choose the value, *x*, at the top right corner of the array
* If *x* is less than zero, then eliminate the entire column (since values decrease down the row).
* Otherwise, do a binary search of the column to either find a 0 or eliminate the column
* If *x* is less than zero, then eliminate that row too.
* Otherwise, do a binary search along the row to either find a 0 or eliminate the row.
* Repeat until search space matrix is empty.
* This should take *O(nlogn)* time

Second attempt

Since there cannot be two zeros in the same row or column, we can use this property to walk the
matrix.

* Go through each column (or each row)
* Do a binary search to find a 0 if it exists
* Eliminate the column (or row)
* Requires *O(nlogn)* for processing the *n* columns and *logn* for binary search across column rows.
