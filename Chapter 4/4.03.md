4-3. Take a sequence of *2n* real numbers as input. Design an *O(nlogn)* algorithm that partitions the numbers into *n* pairs, with the property that the partition minimizes the maximum sum of a pair. For example, say we are given the numbers *(1,3,5,9)*. The possible partitions are *((1,3),(5,9))*, *((1,5),(3,9))*, and *((1,9),(3,5))*. The pair sums for these partitions are *(4,14)*, *(6,12)*, and *(10,8)*. Thus the third partition has *10* as its maximum sum, which is the minimum over the three partitions.
