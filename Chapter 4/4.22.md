4.22 Show that *n* positive integers in the range *1* to *k* can be sorted in *O(nlogk)* time.
The interesting case is when *k<<n*.

**Solution** 

> **Note:** Since the numbers fall in the range *1 - k *, bucket sort can be used but that is not *O(nlogk)*.

 Since we want *O(logn)* time, we could consider using a heap. Inserting each value in the *1 - k* range takes *O(logk)* time.
 Afterwards, we can do a walk of the heap and successively retrieve the items in order. Takes *O(nlogk)* time in total.
 
 The heap values can hold the occurence count of each value in some extra memory storage.
