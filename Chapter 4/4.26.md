4-26. Consider the problem of sorting a sequence of *n* *0's* and *1's* using comparisons. For each comparison of two values *x* and *y*, the algorithm learns which of *x<y*, *x=y*, or *x>y* holds.

1. Give an algorithm to sort in *n−1* comparisons in the worst case. Show that your algorithm is optimal.
2. Give an algorithm to sort in *2n/3* comparisons in the average case (assuming each of the *n* inputs is *0* or *1* with equal probability). Show that your algorithm is optimal.

**Solution**

1. Choose a random pivot, it will either be *0* or *1*; then do the remaining comparisions around it. Worst case is *n-1* comparisions needed.
