4-13. You wish to store a set of *n* numbers in either a max-heap or a sorted array. For each application below, state which data structure is better, or if it does not matter. Explain your answers.

* Want to find the maximum element quickly.

* Want to be able to delete an element quickly.

* Want to be able to form the structure quickly.

* Want to find the minimum element quickly.

**Solution**

* This is a tie - both the max heap and sorted array can give the max element in *O(1)* time

* The max heap is better here as it takes *O(logn)* to delete an element versus *O(n)* for the array (as it requires all elements to be updated)  

* The heap can be built in *O(n)* however the sorted array requires *O(nlogn)* time to build. 

* The array wins here. Minimum element is an *O(1)* operation while for the heap; it's on the order of *O(n)*
