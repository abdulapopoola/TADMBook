4.24 Let *A[1..n]* be an array such that the first *n−√n* elements are already sorted 
(though we know nothing about the remaining elements). Give an algorithm that sorts *A*
 in substantially better than *nlogn* steps.

**Solution** 

The remaining *√n* unsorted elements can be sorted in *O(√nlogn)* time. Both sorted halves
can be merged in *O(n)* time giving a total run time of *O(n) + *O(√nlogn)* which is dominated
by *O(n)*.
