3-11. Suppose that we are given a sequence of n values x1,x2,...,xn and seek to quickly answer repeated queries of the form: given i and j, find the smallest value in xi,…,xj.

 1. Design a data structure that uses *O(n<sup>2</sup>)* space and answers queries in *O(1)* time.
 
 2. Design a data structure that uses *O(n)* space and answers queries in *O(logn)* time. For partial credit, your data structure can use *O(nlogn)* space and have *O(logn)* query time.

**Solution**

 1. Create a *n by n* table which contains the right value for every possible *i* by *j* combination. Retrieve answers in *O(1)* time by using this table.
 
 2.
