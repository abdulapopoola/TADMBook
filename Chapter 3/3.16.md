3-16. Implement versions of several different dictionary data structures, such as linked lists, binary trees, balanced binary search trees, and hash tables. 

Conduct experiments to assess the relative performance of these data structures in a simple application that reads a large text file and reports exactly one instance of each word that appears within it. 

This application can be efficiently implemented by maintaining a dictionary of all distinct words that have appeared thus far in the text and inserting/reporting each word that is not found. Write a brief report with your conclusions.
